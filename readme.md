# Description
This is a simple link saver web app based on IIT Hyderabad's dailly timetable. Fill the form in "Add courses" with the required information and you would have the link available at the right time at the touch of a button.

# Features
* Can validate and store google meet, webex (iith) and teams meet links.
* Can save user's email account 'id' preference to use with google meet.

# Disclaimer
* The objective of making the link's to be stored in a global database is to allow a single person to add them so that other students can use that directly.
* To honour the discipline of those who update links for the entire community to use, please do not add malicious or false links in the system.
